influencer_merchandise_sales_analysis

Data-driven analysis of e-commerce sales and customer reviews for an influencer brand. Includes predictive modeling, qualitative insights, and sales forecasting using ARIMA.

**Objectives:**
- Predict 5-star reviews using structured sales data.
- Identify hidden drivers of customer satisfaction through qualitative analysis.
- Forecast overall and category-specific sales using ARIMA models.

**Methods Used:**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Gini Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest**
- **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Check**
- **ARIMA Forecasting (sales & growth rates)**
- **Qualitative review analysis (positive vs. negative drivers)**

**Key Findings:**
- Existing structured variables (price, buyer age, category, shipping costs) were **not significant** predictors of satisfaction.
- Qualitative analysis showed that **quality, design, and delivery times** were crucial for customer reviews.
- Forecasting models showed **no clear seasonality or trend**, indicating that new variables (e.g., influencer social activity) are needed for better predictions.

**Tools:**
- Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Excel
- ARIMA Forecasting
- Qualitative Data Sampling
